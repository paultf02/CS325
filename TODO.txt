check operator precedence
why are there two minus signs in grammar? line 29 and line 31 in transformedgrammar3
why are there no commas in params?
do we add EOF to the grammar?

now we have first and follow sets
we need to build the table and see how many cells have multiple entries
can we change the grammar so it becomes LL(1)?
can we easily modify the code so we can parse LL(k)?

for ll(k) > 2 we need to compute first_k and follow_k sets
how do we do this

epsilon cannot be in any follow sets

revise the whole no epsilon productions stuff
